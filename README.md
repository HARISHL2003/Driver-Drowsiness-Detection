# Driver Drowsiness Detection ðŸš—ðŸ’¤

This is the official repository for our **Driver Drowsiness Detection** system, developed as part of the **EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service)** initiative at **VIT Bhopal**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Driver drowsiness is a major cause of road accidents worldwide. This project aims to build a **real-time drowsiness detection system** that can alert drivers before their drowsiness turns into a risk.

Our solution uses **deep learning (transfer learning with MobileNet)** and **OpenCV** for accurate detection of eye closure in real time. Additionally, we implemented a **virtual hardware simulation** using **Proteus** to showcase future real-world applications of this technology.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Real-time face and eye detection using **Haarcascade** (OpenCV)
- âœ… **Transfer Learning (MobileNet)** for classifying eye state (open/closed)
- âœ… Real-time alert system (Buzzer & LED simulated)
- âœ… **Proteus** + **VSPE** integration for virtual testing of embedded prototype
- âœ… Comparison with other models (SVM, Random Forest, KNN)
